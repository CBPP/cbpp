# Linuxìè¢, A CrunchBang revival project.

In 2015, Philip Newborough -- Corenominal -- had officially discontinued his efforts with the fast and light distro. While Philip believes that the project no longer serves the Linux space in the way he had originally intended, we believe that #! still has great potential and serves the Linux community as the perfect combination of elegance and efficiency.

We'd like to thank Philip for all his hard work through the years, the legacy he's created, and the bar he's set for sleek high-performance distros.
