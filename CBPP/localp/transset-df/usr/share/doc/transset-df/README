This is a patched version of xorg's transset
I wanted to integrate transset into my windowmanager and to
be able to set and unset transparency by just pressing a key.
To make that possible I added several different 'select methods'.
The first one was 'select by point' and lets the user run transset
directly on the window curently under the cursor without bringing 
up the crosshair. Later select by name and id was added after insperation
from other transset patches.

In the future I guess it's ment for the windowmanagers to handle
transparency. Then we will hopefully see these functions and many other
now imposible function. This will however require you to wait untill this is
implementet in your favorite wm. This patch is a way of "scratching where it 
itches", by creating a usefull integration with every windowmanager without 
changing any wm-code. And it's a very "unix way" of doing things too :)

Features
	*select window by clicking (as transset)
	*select actual focused X11 window
	*select window by pointing
	*select by window name or id
	*force toggle
	*increase or decrease opacity
