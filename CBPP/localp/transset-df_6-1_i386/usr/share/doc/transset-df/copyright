 transset-df is a fork of of the program transset, originally written 
 by Matthew Hawn, and is released under the same public domain
 license: "Use however you want."
 .
 The author of transset-df, Daniel Forchheimer, clarified the license
 in a private email to me, Daniel Moerner, that was partially forwarded
 to http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=30;att=0;bug=494863
 and is reproduced here:

 > The usage agreements are stated in the source code files. When I first 
 > released transset-df I decided to keep the same kind of "license" agreement 
 > as the original transset. The original code simply has a comment that says 
 > "Use however you want" and I have kept that note throughout all the 
 > releases. My interpretation of that is that it is "public domain", there are
 > no restrictions at all on copying, modifying, selling, or even releasing 
 > under a new license etc. So given that there are no restrictions at all I 
 > can't see how that can be incompatible with debian. Let me know if you run 
 > into any problems with that and I can consider making a re-release with some 
 > clearer license text.
