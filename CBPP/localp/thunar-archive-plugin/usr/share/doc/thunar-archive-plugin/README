What is it?
===========

The thunar-archive-plugin is a plugin for the Thunar File Manager, which
adds archive operations to the file context menus. Using this plugin you
will be able to extract and create archive files from within Thunar using
a single click.


Required packages
=================

thunar-archive-plugin depends on the following packages:

 - Thunar 0.4.0 or above


Supported archive managers
==========================

thunar-archive-plugin currently supports file-roller (the GNOME archive manager)
and ark (the KDE archive manager), but support for additional archive managers
can be easily added.

To add support for a new archive manager, all you need to do is to install
the .desktop file - with the list of supported mime types - for the archive
manager to the $(datadir)/applications/ folder (as usual), and in addition,
install a .tap file to $(libexecdir)/thunar-archive-plugin/, which provides
a wrapper script that invokes the archive manager with the appropriate
parameters for the actions "Create Archive", "Extract Here" and "Extract To".

The .tap and .desktop files should have the same basename, otherwise the
thunar-archive-plugin is not able to find the appropriate .tap file for an
archive manager. For example, if the name of the .desktop file is ark.desktop,
the .tap file must be named ark.tap.

See the scripts/ directory for examples of how to create said .tap files. The
template.tap file should provide a good starting point.

Note that the thunar-archive-plugin takes the applications from the desktop
database, so after installing new archive managers in $prefix (i.e. /usr or
/usr/local), make sure to run

 update-desktop-database $prefix/share/applications

Most modern packagement systems will do this for you automatically, but if
you are installing archive managers manually, you may need to run the above
command first, otherwise you will get an error message telling you that no
support archive managers were found on your system.
