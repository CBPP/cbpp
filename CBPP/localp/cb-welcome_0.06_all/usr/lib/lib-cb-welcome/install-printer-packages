  PRINTER SUPPORT
  ---------------
  By default, CrunchBang does not come with printer support. Would you like
  to add printer support now? If you choose to do this, the following package
  will be installed:

      cb-meta-printer-support

  Note: additional packages listed as dependencies will also be installed."

if prompt "  Would you like to install printer support?"; then
	sudo apt-get install -y cb-meta-printer-support
