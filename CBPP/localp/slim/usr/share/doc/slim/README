    - External themes and configuration
    - PNG support with alpha transparency for panel
    - PNG / JPEG support for backgrounds
    - XFT / freetype support
    - Double or single (GDM-style) inputbox support
    - CMake build procedure

USAGE

    To launch slim, execute run the slim binary,
    followed by the -d option if you want it to
    run as a daemon in the background (reccommended)
    
    enter username and password to login. The ~/.xinitrc
    file is executed by default, so be sure to have a working
    .xinitrc file in your home.
    
    Special usernames (commands configurable in the config file):
    - console: start console login
    - exit: exit SLiM
    - halt: halt the system
    - reboot: reboot the system
    
    pressing the F11 key executes a user-specified
    command (see the configuration file), the default
    is to take a screenshot if the 'import' program is available.
