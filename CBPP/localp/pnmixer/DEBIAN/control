Description: Volume mixer for the system tray
 PNMixer is a simple mixer application designed to run in your
 system tray. It integrates nicely into desktop environments that
 don't have a panel that supports applets, and therefore can't run
 a mixer applet. In particular it's been used quite a lot with
 fbpanel and tint2, but should run fine in any system tray.
