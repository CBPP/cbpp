* listen to client when they request a position to 'point to', maybe have a
  little arrow thingy point off the notification window
* window shadow?  would rather the compositor just do this, need to figure out
  why xfwm4 won't -- olivier says shaped windows never get shadows
* make more parts of the notification themable
* find a way to completely ditch the old theme when switching to a new one --
  implemented workaround: kill daemon on theme change
* prelight fill for close button circle?
* add a widget to select the notification position?
* add more possible notification positions (middle of edges)
